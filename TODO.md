## Wrapped 2025

The year 2025 was very special to me. I met new people, enhanced my knowledge in computer science, competed in robotics and game dev competitions and contributed to Open Source Projects. All of it felt like a dream came true and I am gratefull for all of my  experiences i had. 

### Vantor
At the beginning of 2025, I returned to Computer Graphics and started my personal dream project — a Game Engine Kernel designed to be so minimal that anything can be built on top of it. The core idea is to keep the engine extremely small and extend it through so-called VNodes, modular components that directly manipulate the kernel and engine behaviour. With these building blocks, it should be possible to create custom game engines or graphics software tailored to specific needs.

This project is still continuing today, and Mate Salanki has joined me in working on it, so we can push our dream engine forward even faster.

After many attempts to get my first engine demos running and properly documented, I felt like I needed a break. Snowy weather, hot tea, and a relaxed coding session with a friend sounded like exactly the right thing — and I wanted to actually finish something within a short time.

So my best friend Moritz Rottensteiner and I participated in the 5th 1-Bit Game Jam (https://itch.io/jam/1-bit-jam-5
). We quickly set up a C++ project using Raylib, and the theme turned out to be Winter. Over the course of a week we built a small platformer about a wanderer exploring a large ancient cave and solving puzzles. We called the game FrozenCore.

Moritz spent countless hours creating the pixel art while I focused on programming, and a new friend we met during the jam, Tim Kulig, composed the music. In the end we reached 153rd place out of 206 entries, which was a solid result for our first game jam.

Around that time many of my classmates were applying for summer internships at small companies, but I felt that applying in 9th grade would not give me the chance to gain meaningful experience yet. Instead, I started looking for opportunities in open source projects.

Since I am especially interested in graphics programming, Blender seemed like the perfect choice. The main question was how to actually get involved. My solution was simple: I wrote an email describing my projects and my interest in working on the real-time renderer EEVEE.

Only a few hours later I received a reply from the CEO himself. Ton Roosendaal quickly connected me with the appropriate module maintainer, and during the summer months I was able to fix several bugs. These contributions were eventually shipped with the 5.0 release of the project.

When the second year of high school started, I was excited to join our school's robotics club. The club has won multiple Botball world championships, which made me even more motivated to start my own journey there.

Together with several classmates, I helped lead the team TRACER. As preparation for the Botball European Open Championship, we participated in the local comp-AIR competition. We finished in second place overall, and I received the Best Code Award.

Now I am working on this website to reflect my journey and experiences — a journey that is not only about computer science, but about real progress.

Even as AI becomes more important, I am still here writing this blog and building things myself. I am already looking forward to the next wrapped of my developer life in 2026.
