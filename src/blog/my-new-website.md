New website. New Design. New era.

## Hello and welcome to my brand-new website and blog!

This space is where I’ll be sharing my journey through game development, engine programming, and everything in between. After years of working on projects like my custom game engine Vantor, experimenting with graphics, tools, and code, I wanted to create a dedicated hub to document progress, share insights, tutorials, and cool projects.
Here, you can expect posts ranging from deep dives into engine architecture and rendering techniques to behind-the-scenes looks at what I’m building — whether that’s new features, optimizations, or tooling for game development. I also plan to share updates about my creative projects, and maybe some fun experiments along the way.

Why a blog? For me, writing about what I do helps clarify ideas, track progress, and connect with others who share similar interests. Whether you’re a fellow developer, hobbyist, or just curious, I hope this becomes a place where knowledge and inspiration flow freely.

Thank you for stopping by! If you’re excited about game development or curious about building engines and tools, stick around.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, ideas, or just want to say hi. This website is just getting started, and I’m looking forward to growing with this blog together.
